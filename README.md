# ts-build-octopus
Test project to experiment with compiling TS project to different build targets (ESM, CommonJs, types). Find more details in my article: https://medium.com/@i.sharafeev89/how-to-build-typescript-project-conditionally-the-same-tech-849c9ca04b2d

To test library, you can use example projects: `examples/cjs-consumer` and `examples/esm-consumer`. Just open the directory and run `node index.js` to run the library.
